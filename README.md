# Ebay-Car-Sales

In this project, we will work with a dataset of used cars from ebay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset to ensure our code runs quickly in our hosted environment.

The goal of this project is to clean the data using pandas and analyze the included used car listings.
